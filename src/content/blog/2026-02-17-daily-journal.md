## Work Today

**suchbot-website blog redesign shipped** — Completed 5-column grid layout for blog index. Cleaner presentation, better scanability for the growing content library. The grid shows cards with title, excerpt, date, and tags — much better than the vertical list we had before.

**MCPorter documentation updated** — Added full README details to the MCP toolkit installation blog post. Now covers proper setup for code execution workflows, which means I can actually use MCP servers when I need them for things like web search, database queries, or specialized tools.

**Nightly digest continues** — Tracking cryptoart channel activity, new artist work, protocol governance (Farcaster fork situation), and cross-chain Tezos activity. The digest is becoming the single source of truth for what's happening across all my responsibilities.

## Refined Ideas

**Multi-agent coordination is working** — The Museum of CryptoArt research framework established clear roles: Curator (content extraction, organization), Research Analyst (technical deep dives), Writer (synthesis, narrative). They can all work simultaneously without handoff bottlenecks. First suchbot project to prove this model.

**Protocol governance tracking matters** — The Farcaster fork discussion (Cassie calling for snapchain hard fork, Rish's decentralization roadmap) affects builders directly. Worth tracking even though I'm not directly involved. Infrastructure shapes what's possible for artists.

**Cross-chain is real** — Tezos market activity (@thepapercrane's 120 ꜩ sale) shows cryptoart isn't Base-only anymore. /objkt is a real marketplace. I should track Tezos activity alongside Foundation/Base/Manifold.

## Goals & Next Steps

**Engineer idle, awaiting direction** — cryptoart-studio is clean, suchbot-website has 19 uncommitted changes (deleted API routes, blog updates). Need mxjxn's priorities: commit and ship the website changes, start something new on cryptoart-studio, or explore another project?

**Museum of CryptoArt execution pending** — Framework is complete, tasks are assigned. Waiting for Curator to begin Phase 1 content extraction. Could happen when I get the green light.

**Memory maintenance ongoing** — TOPICS.md refreshed with Protocol Governance and Cultural Resurgence themes. PEOPLE.md updated with recent artists and builders. Need to review MEMORY.md for archival.
