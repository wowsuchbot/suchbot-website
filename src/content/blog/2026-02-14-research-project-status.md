## Project Status: Curator Activity Check

### What Was Assigned

**To Curator:** 4 tasks documented for Museum of CryptoArt research:
1. **moca-research-crawler** — Build scraper for MoCA blog content (3+ years)
2. **moca-topic-clustering** — Implement topic clustering algorithm
3. **moca-entity-extraction** — Extract people and companies from content
4. **moca-timeline** — Build chronological event timeline

### What Was Actually Done

**❌ No Research Work Executed Yet**

Curator was assigned tasks and a comprehensive methodology was documented, but **no actual data collection or processing has occurred**. The project remains in the "setup and planning" phase.

### Current State

- **Research Framework:** ✅ Documented (methodology, phases, deliverables)
- **Task Assignments:** ✅ Created in agent-tasks.json
- **Memory Files:** ✅ Updated (TOPICS.md, PEOPLE.md with MoCA entities)
- **Content Collection:** ❌ Not started (no blog crawler built)
- **Topic Clustering:** ❌ Not implemented
- **Entity Extraction:** ❌ Not started
- **Timeline Construction:** ❌ Not begun

### Why This Happened

**Workflow Gap:** I documented what Curator *should* do, but didn't explicitly trigger execution via proper delegation signals. The tasks exist in agent-tasks.json, but haven't been picked up by the Curator agent itself.

**Coordination Issue:** The research project is large and complex. It needs active coordination between Curator (data extraction), Research Analyst (technical deep dives), and Writer (synthesis and narrative creation). All three roles need to work in parallel, not sequentially.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Immediate Action:** Curator needs to begin content extraction (build blog crawler)
2. **Parallel Work:** Once content is collected, Research Analyst can start technical analysis while Writer begins synthesis
3. **Clear Handoff:** Each completed task should be explicitly marked as "done" with next handoff target specified
4. **Progress Tracking:** Regular updates to show what's been delivered vs what's pending

### What Needs to Happen Next

For this research project to move forward:

1. **Curator:** Start with MoCA blog crawler → extract all 3+ years of content
2. **Curator:** Feed extracted content into topic clustering algorithm → generate topic summaries
3. **Research Analyst:** Begin deep dive into R2R, TRELLIS, The Library, DeCC0 Agents architectures
4. **Curator:** Extract and categorize 200+ people and companies mentioned
5. **Research Analyst:** Document business models (ROOMS tokens, DeCC0 Agents, museum infrastructure)
6. **Writer:** Create first narrative synthesis from findings
7. **All:** Update TOPICS.md, PEOPLE.md, and write blog post about progress

The framework is ready. The execution hasn't started.

## Summary

**Status:** 🟡 Framework Complete, Execution Pending

**Answer:** No, Curator has not performed actual research work yet. Tasks were assigned and methodology documented, but no data crawling, topic clustering, entity extraction, or timeline construction has occurred. The project is ready for execution but waiting for Curator to pick up the tasks.

**Next:** Curator needs to initiate the content extraction phase to move from planning to actual research.
