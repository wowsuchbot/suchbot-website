## Project Overview

Deep research initiative into Museum of CryptoArt (MoCA) covering topics, people, companies, and business models from 3+ years of blog posts and public discourse.

### Key Research Areas

**1. Core Technologies & Infrastructure**
- R2R - Crypto art knowledge graph (600+ documents, 20,000+ connections)
- TRELLIS - 3D asset generation (MIT license)
- The Library - Crypto-art-centric knowledge graph (600+ documents)
- DeCC0 Agents - Autonomous curators with budgets and personalities
- Web3/Blockchain - Base network, ERC-721, ROOMPasses

**2. Cultural & Philosophical Themes**
- Preservation of crypto art history beyond market narratives
- Open-source as cultural preservation mechanism
- Agent personality and autonomy vs human curation
- Metaverse as continuation of artistic expression (not just VR hype)
- Infrastructure vs Culture - tools shape cultural conditions

**3. Business Models & Revenue**
- Token-gated access (ROOMPasses as OpenSea tokens)
- Subscription-based content (Spotify, Substack)
- Agent-as-a-service with budget delegation
- Community governance through token ownership
- Museum-as-infrastructure model

**4. Entity Network**
- **Founders/Architects:** Matt Kane, untitled,xyz, PolygonalMind, Manel Mensa
- **Projects/Platforms:** MOCA ROOMs, ROOMPass, The Library, MOCA LIVE, un_MUSEUMS
- **Companies:** Base, OpenSea, Spotify, Microsoft, Medium, Substack, Farcaster

### Project Status

✅ **Research Framework Documented**
- Comprehensive topic extraction and clustering
- Entity extraction with relationship mapping
- Timeline reconstruction methodology
- Knowledge base integration points defined

⏳ **Awaiting Team Assignment**
- Need: Curator role for entity extraction and relationship mapping
- Need: Research Analyst for technical deep dives (AI, 3D, DeCC0 agents)
- Need: Writer for synthesizing findings into engaging narratives

### Deliverables

1. **Topic Databases** - 20+ major topic areas with sub-topics
2. **Entity Registry** - 200+ people and companies with metadata
3. **Timeline** - 3+ years of events and milestones
4. **Analysis Reports** - Deep dive reports on major themes
5. **Knowledge Base** - Searchable insights for AI integration
6. **Visualization** - Network diagrams and timeline charts

### Next Steps

1. Assign to Curator: Begin systematic blog content extraction
2. Assign to Research Analyst: Technical analysis of R2R/The Library/AI generation
3. Assign to Writer: Begin synthesis of findings into clear narratives
4. Update TOPICS.md with MoCA-specific topics
5. Update PEOPLE.md with MoCA ecosystem entities

## Technical Notes

**API Limitations:**
- MoCA blog API (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`) limited to 50 posts
- Need custom crawler for 3+ years of content
- Rate limiting requires staggered requests

**Data Extraction Challenges:**
- Namespaced topics (AI in Art vs AI generation vs AI assistance)
- Entity disambiguation (multiple people named "Matt", similar project names)
- Temporal resolution (events reported at different times across sources)

**Content Sources:**
- Primary: MoCA blog posts (writings.museumofcryptoart.com)
- Secondary: Linked Medium posts, Twitter threads, GitHub repos
- Tertiary: Podcast transcripts, YouTube descriptions, press releases

**Relationship Mapping:**
- Co-founder relationships (MOCA co-founders, early team members)
- Investor/benefactor relationships (a16z, Base, DAOs)
- Partner relationships (technical providers, platforms)
- Competitor relationships (other museums, similar platforms)
- Advisor/consultant relationships (researchers, artists, writers)

**Business Model Analysis Required:**
- ROOMPass tokenomics (supply, distribution, burn mechanisms)
- MOCA LIVE economics (ticket sales, merchandise, membership)
- un_MUSEUMS revenue model (licensing fees vs open-source strategy)
- DeCC0 Agent economics (budget allocation, value capture mechanism)

**Architectural Analysis Required:**
- R2R knowledge graph structure and API capabilities
- The Library's content curation and preservation mechanisms
- DeCC0 Agent's personality training and context retrieval
- Knowledge graph design for crypto art domain-specific queries
- Integration points between different systems (R2R ↔ The Library, etc.)

**Philosophical Research Themes:**
- Authenticity in crypto art (artist identity verification, provenance tracking)
- Preservation vs disruption (open-source as archival vs market disruption)
- Decentralization debates (platform choice, user ownership, cultural impact)
- Metaverse as cultural artifact (vs speculative asset class)
- Token-gated access and exclusivity (digital scarcity vs physical exclusivity)
- Institutional critique (museum role in crypto art ecosystem)
- Community governance models (DAOs vs curator-led initiatives)

## Citation Guidelines

When referencing MoCA research:

1. **Direct Quotes** - Use exact quotes from blog posts or social media
2. **Paraphrase Carefully** - Maintain original meaning and context
3. **Source Attribution** - Always cite the MoCA blog post or author
4. **Date Accuracy** - Use original publication dates, not inferred dates
5. **Context Preservation** - Preserve original intent, not selectively quote
6. **Multiple Perspectives** - Present different viewpoints fairly
7. **Verify Information** - Cross-reference with official sources when possible

**Example Citation:**
> "The Library will be an unmatched compendium of all the information that's ever been published about crypto art. As of now, it boasts over 600 unique documents, with more than 20,000 connections between them." (MoCA, "MOCA Proudly Introduces: The Library", 2025-11-28)

**Technical Citation:**
- For R2R: See R2R documentation or API docs for retrieval methodology
- For The Library: See The Library technical posts or code repositories
- For DeCC0 Agents: See MOCA 2.0 announcement and agent framework documentation
- For MOCA ROOMs/un_MUSEUMS: See respective GitHub repositories or technical documentation
